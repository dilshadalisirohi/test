Digital Base uses your personal information only when we have a valid legal basis to do so. The following shows you the legal basis for the various ways in which we process your personal information:<br/>‍<br/><strong>Contractual Necessity<br/>‍</strong>Contractual necessity means that we need to process your personal information in order to provide you with Services you have requested.  Personal information we process under the legal basis of contractual necessity include:<br/>‍<br/>Contact data (e.g., name, address, email, phone number)<br/>Profile data (e.g., age, birthday)<br/>Account data (e.g., phone number<br/>)Device data (e.g., device ID)<br/>IP addressLocation data<br/>Analytics data<br/>Video metadata<br/>Videos<br/>Photos<br/>Legitimate Business Interest<br/>Sometimes we process your personal information to further the legitimate business interests of Digital Base or a third-party. Legitimate business interests means that processing your personal information is an important part of Digital Base operating its business and providing Services to you. Examples of these legitimate business interests include:<br/>‍<br/>Operation and improvement of our business, products, and services<br/>Marketing of our products and services<br/>Provision of customer support<br/>Protection from fraud or security threats<br/>Compliance with legal obligations<br/>Completion of corporate transactions<br/>Personal information that we process under the legal basis of legitimate business interests includes:<br/>‍<br/>Contact data (e.g., name, address, email, phone number, personal and/or company social media accounts)<br/>Profile data (e.g., school, clothing size)<br/>Account data (e.g. phone number)<br/>Age and birthday<br/>Analytics data (e.g., IP address)<br/>Videos<br/>Consent<br/>‍<br/>In some cases, we process your personal information only after you have given us consent to do so, such as when we conduct certain marketing activities. You are always free not to provide consent, or to withdraw your consent at any time after it has been given.  <br/>‍<br/><strong>Other Processing Grounds<br/>‍</strong>From time to time, although it is very rare, we may also need to process your personal information to comply with a legal obligation, if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or other individuals, or if it is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest.<br/>Digital Base retains personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including as described in this Privacy Policy, or as required by law.<br/>‍<br/><strong>WILL DIGITAL BASE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION?<br/>‍</strong>We may share your personal information with third-parties that help us provide Services and do business. These third-parties include:<br/>Advertisers: We may allow advertisers and/or merchant partners (“Advertisers”) to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers.  You agree that we may provide any of the information we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to an Advertiser, in order for that Advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements and/or offers. For example, we might use the fact you are located in New York to show you ads or offers for New York businesses, but we will not tell such businesses who you are. Or, we might allow Advertisers to display their ads to users with similar usage patterns to yours, but we will not disclose usage information to Advertisers except in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally.  Note that if an advertiser asks us to show an ad to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that ad, the advertiser may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach.<br/>‍<br/>We may deliver a file to you through the Services (known as a “web beacon”) from an ad network. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. You may be able to opt-out of web beacon tracking conducted by third-parties through our Services by adjusting the Do Not Track settings on your browser. Please note that we don’t control whether or how these third parties comply with Do Not Track requests.<br/>‍<br/>Affiliated Businesses: In certain situations, businesses or third-party websites we are affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us).  You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your personal information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or Service. We have no control over the policies and practices of third-party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.<br/>‍<br/>Service Providers: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or Services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our service providers do not have any right to use the personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.<br/>‍<br/>Business Transfers: We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may share and/or transfer customer personal information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, personal information could be one of the assets transferred or acquired as part of this process.<br/>‍<br/>Protection of Digitla Base and Others: We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with any law or court order; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Digital Base, our employees, our users, or others.<br/>‍<br/><strong>DOES DIGITAL BASE SECURE PERSONAL INFORMATION?<br/>‍</strong>At Digital Base, we use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your personal information, taking into account the nature of the personal information, the processing, and the threats posed.
